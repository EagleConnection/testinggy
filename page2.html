        <p>Football is basically my favorite sports. I played orffesional football when i was younger.
           I played for TGD Essen West in Essen. TGD is was a third division club alongside Rot Weiss Essen in Regionalliga,
           North West Germany. My football career ended prematurely when sustained a serious west injury during a home match.
           I was taken to the hospital and had severe pains for months and could not work properly. I was warned by an orthopadic doctor 
           that i shouyld avoid playing footbal if i do not want to end up on wheelchair. I complied with the advice and stopped
           playing the game i loved so much. This incident hindered my progress to play more proffessional games both home and abroad
           However, after many years of staying away from soccer, I retured to the pitch again to play with an amature football club
           club in Manchester called FC Vanpersec. Vampersec is a club for retired football lovers and proffessionals. We play every weekend 
           for fun and to keep feet. The club is a collection of old and young players and we all have fun together every saturdy for 3 hours.
           We nromally train at Manchester City stadium but because of the renovation we moved our training ground to Power league  Manchester.
           Furthermore, i am a great Manchester United fan and my favorite football play is Christiano Ronaldonr 7. 
           My two boys are really kicking good footballs,I believe they will excel in proffessional football in future if they work hard towards it.
