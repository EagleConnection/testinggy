        <p>Formular One, pupularly known as F1 is one of my favourite sports. I love fast cars and i love seeing
            talented drivers racing. I having been watching F1 since my young age, i have also played F1 games when i was growing up.
            I also engage in go karting race with friends. I used to be a great fan of Michael Schumacher, Nicky Lauder, Pablo Montoya,
            Kimi Reikonen and Janson Buton. I love seeing Sabastine Vettel race but more importantly i have great respect for thr overall F1 chanpion 
            Sir Lewis Hamilton. Sir Hemilton has broken all F1 records and about to break the last recored of getting the eight championship
            title. This will make him oustanding because the nearest contenter is Michael Schumacker with seven world champions. Lewis 
            has made the sports more attractive to every young kid out there especially the ethnic minorities because he started from a noble
            background. H ehas given hope to many and provided opportunity for others in the F1 industry. I am happy that one of my son is
            intersted in F1 and i will do all i can to support him to excel if that is what he intends to do in the future. F1 is so exciting
            that i wont stop watching and i prioritise it more than other sports on SKY TV. I am a great fan and i even travel to Silverston to 
            #watch the race live, as well as in Germany, Holland and Belgium. I use to be a Ferrarri fan but i folloewd Hamilton from Mclaren
            to Mercedes AMG Petronas. I also like Hamilton team manager Toto Wolf and his current collegue driver Botas.
